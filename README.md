# Paledit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.7.

This is my first Angular project. I am using it to try and familiarize myself with the workings of Angular.

I intend to make this into a palette editor for old-school games, particularly FPSes like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, etc.

## Setting up Paledit

You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) installed in order to run Paledit.

Open a terminal/command prompt, go to the Paledit directory, and type `npm install` to install the node modules you need in order to run Paledit.

## Running Paledit

If you have Paledit set up, open a terminal/command prompt, go to the Paledit directory, and type `ng serve` in order to start the server for Paledit.

Open [Paledit](http://localhost:4200) in your browser by going to http://localhost:4200. This will only work if the Paledit server is running.

Press Ctrl-C on the terminal to stop the server for Paledit.
